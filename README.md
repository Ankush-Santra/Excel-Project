# Dashboard Purpose

This dashboard is designed to **assist job seekers** in **data-related fields** by providing a quick analysis of the job market. It highlights key metrics such as expected salaries and job benefits. The primary audience for this tool includes job seekers with specific goals, such as:

*   The position they are applying for
*   Desired work schedules
*   Preferences for remote opportunities

For those who prefer a broader view, I recommend exploring the second dashboard, which offers a more comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of the job market without any filters.
